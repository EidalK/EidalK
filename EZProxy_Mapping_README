To make the code work you'll need to do some pre-processing and mid-processing.
Also, code assumes file naming and location. 
Run IP_resolve first.
Process the IP addresses.
Then run Mapping.

Before running IP_resolve, you will need to copy EZProxy Audit logs into a csv. Do some basic cleaning in Excel of removing unneeded rows.
Save as Cleaned_EZProxy.csv

After running IP_resolve and before running Mapping, use an IP address resolving site to get latitudes and longitudes. (Column names are assumed from information produced from://www.showmyip.com/bulk-ip-lookup/)

Mapping will produce 3 types of maps, and download 2.
